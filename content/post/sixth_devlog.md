I've been failing a lot lately and I'm trying not to get discouraged or to oversimplify the project. I keep telling myself this will be straightforward or I just have to find a guide and then it'll all come together. Unfortunately, it's not coming together at all. I have my coins and I have ideas and articles re: each coin, but I can't get any further. I've been struggling to figure out how to get a zoomify link to work on StoryMap and each time I think I've got it working it breaks. 

I think I've been spending too much time on the final product and not enough time on the actual content. In this next week I'm going to focus more on creating the content and locating research/articles that will support my project. I borrow a camera from my supervisor so I'm going to work on taking high resolution photos myself and see if working with higher quality images and new tile application will make everything work!

Things I've tried so far:

- I took an image from the internet and put it through a tile creation application. It produced multiple tile versions of the Terry Fox coin I'm using.
- I uploaded these images to my github repo and linked them to StoryMap. *this did not work*
- Next, I figured out how to create subfolders in github and then re-uploaded a selection of images. Now I had a new link and less photos. Then I checked StoryMap and *this didn't work either...* 


Next steps:

- Find a guide (that I understand) for creating tile images and linking it to StoryMap
- Work on content creation and analysis
- Take my own high resolution images of the coins
- **Ask for help**
