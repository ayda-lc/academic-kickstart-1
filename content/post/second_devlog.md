Project: Accessibility on campus

Approach: Projecting the names of buildings on-campus onto their signs with projecting mapping in ASL or perhaps braille (?). I've also been thinking about whether it would be possible to print out stickers and actually affix these building names over the signs of all the buildings on campus. 

Methods: Projection mapping and stickers

Scope: I think it would also be cool to do something on-campus about physical accessibility. I'm not 100% sure how to approach this...Maybe I interview people or read about accessibility policies on campus and project them onto buildings. OR maybe even projecting questions about accessibility policies and concerns on buildings so that passersby are forced to question how accessbile the space is for them. 

Product(s): I could create a digital map with tags of all the signs on campus and videos of accessibility statements or concerns on the building.
