I had a brilliant idea! Picture it: my Storymap is still not working, the deadline is approaching, and I’ve just narrowed the scope of my project drastically. Now envision that you’re sitting in the back of a Greyhound bus and working away on this project. Inspiration is born in some of the weirdest places…

While doing my analysis of my coins I thought about all the ways that I could re-design these coins if given the chance. I envisioned changing the dates on some coins and completing messing with the images on others. And then I thought, why not do it? Why not re-issue these coins. Altering a coin or a government-issued document is very guerrilla and very creative. I also liked that I didn’t need much technology to do it. I’m not a great artist so drawing it wasn’t going to work but I am familiar with design and manipulating graphics online. So, that’s what I did. I used Microsoft Paint 3D.

I took the right to vote coin and changed the timeline to read: 1916-1960. It was almost indiscernible, and I was pleased. Then I took the flag anniversary coin and cut out the maple leaf flag—this felt weird. I looked at some of the flag submissions online from the National Archives and dropped them onto the obverse of the coin. And for the equality coin, I abandoned their design completely. I changed the coin to reflect LGBTQ2+ resistance and found an online template to use for my coin background. I “lifted” the human figures from the famous Ignorance = Fear / Silence = Death graphic and placed them in the foreground of the large pink triangle.

Uploading these images and getting my repositories to work was a different story though. I broke my site multiple times and had to ask Marissa for help. At first the images wouldn’t show up—so Marissa directed me to her devlogs and repo to find the code. This worked on the original site, but once I broke it, I had to build a brand-new site from GitHub Pages using markdown. I had to figure out a new code for getting links and images to show up. Once I got the all the folders, files and photos working the site was running smoothly. It only took 2 days of struggling with netlify, github and my own motivation to come up with a solution for my project that suited me and my interests. And now I’m done.
