Alright so we're back to the drawing board! We have ideas though. The new goal is to create a story map with a high res image and use coins that I have and that the Bank of Canada Museum or Mint has official descriptions about. Then my project will zoom into specific tiles of the coins to examine the intersections and narrate the other stories hidden within the image and design of the coin.

Next steps:

1. **Return to the Bank of Canada Museum**

2. **Visit the Mint Museum**

3. **Continue to collect stories/articles related to the selected coins**

4. **Begin analyzing the designs/coins**

5. **Complete one full coin on storymap for next class** or **Complete 2 full analyses of coins**

6. **Build github repository**

7. **Create Medium account**
