I'm looking forward to building this site and playing around with this software to create other websites. 

I've been working on a separate website and building a different project. In this process I've learned a lot about what github is and how it works. It's also involved a lot of research, that while unrelated, has been helping me figure out how to make content accessible and scoping a project out to be both feasible and accessible.
