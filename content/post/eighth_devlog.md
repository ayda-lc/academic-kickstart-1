A few weeks ago, I had decided on a set of seven coins that I wanted to use for my project, but the criteria I had used to make my decisions wasn’t relevant to what I wanted to do anymore. I had been focussing more on what stories I could tell and how I could analyze the coins instead of what stories I could disrupt and what narratives were missing.
My initial coin choices were:

-	Parks Canada Centennial 
-	Women’s Right to Vote 
-	Terry Fox Marathon of Hope 
-	50th Anniversary of the Red Maple Leaf Flag 
-	2010 Olympic Moment: Cindy Klassen
-	Peacekeeping Efforts
-	War of 1812: Laura Secord

I had selected seven coins and planned to critically analyze all of them. I had overshot and was feeling very overwhelmed by everything. Nothing was coming together. It felt like all my peers were making headway on their projects and I was stagnating. I wasn’t feeling passionate about my project and was losing control of it.
In a last-ditch effort to get some momentum I decided to start my analysis. I started with the coins that I found the most exciting: the right to vote coin and the Canadian flag coin. Before I knew it, the analysis was flowing in a few short hours I had written the counter-stories for these coins and found corresponding websites, videos and articles/books to complement my work.
It occurred to me that these coins were easier to analyze because they were anniversaries and relied on core narratives to make them memorable. So, I decided to expand my timeline and consider other anniversaries and coins with national narratives that I could disrupt. Narrowing my scope to three coins, I decided to analyze the Equality loonie from 2019 celebrating 50 years since the decriminalization of homosexuality. 

- Flag anniversary narrative: I wanted to disrupt narratives of national unity and identity by unpacking the controversy and differing opinions on the project of a new national flag in 1965.

- Right to vote narrative: I wanted to highlight how much this coin obfuscates by celebrating 100 years of women voting. The goal was to make my audience and stop and engage with the narrative that the government is trying to further. Is it true? Are there omissions in this narrative? And if so, what purposes do they serve?

- Lgbtq2+ rights narrative: This coin is a bold-faced lie. It’s infuriating and stands in sharp contrast to the apology given by Trudeau in 2017 for the LGBTQ Purge. This is one of the narratives I was most passionate about disrupting and re-telling.
