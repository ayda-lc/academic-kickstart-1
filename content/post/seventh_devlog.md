Working on this project has taught me to be okay with asking for help. After talking to Shawn and learning how to build a new repo and use that link to host my images I thought I was done! And then I saw this:

My coin uploaded in a distorted and disproportionate image. It took everything I had not to cry, so I laughed instead. Now all I had to do was figure out to get it build properly and then I’d be set! The next two coins I worked on were not good. They kept breaking (i.e. would not load) or kept melting (i.e. would not generate proportionate images).

So, I opted to take my own high-res images. At this point, I decided I would take them using the Canon 5DII I was already using for my RTI work. This did not work. Coins are very difficult to work with in almost every way. I struggled to get a good quality image of my coins. After about 30 minutes I managed to get a decent set of images and tried to upload them. Many technical difficulties later I gave up on this and asked a friend to export an image as a zoomify set using photoshop. These turned out great! However, uploading them from google drive to dropbox and then dropbox to github was tenuous. I also gave up on this briefly and decided to focus on the content of my project. It would do me no good to have a working URL and dataset without any analysis or content.

I later learned that the reason my images were uploading in a weird way could in fact be that I was using jpegs instead of raw high-resolution images. The person I asked also went on to explain that it might have something to do with jpegs using averages and Storymap JS not being able to correctly construct an image based on these approximations. In short, I either needed to take new images or start over…
