So we're going back to the drawing board now. My old idea was half-baked. I wasn't sure how easy it would be to come up with a new topic but Shawn and I brainstormed another idea that involved coins and would actually help me with my MRP. 

The plan is to create a mindmap or something similar to those webs of "Six Degrees of Separation" and visually show how critical lenses of analysis intersect in the stories and images on commemorative coins.

I'm working on a coggle map for right now and then over the break I'm going to try and research R Studio.
